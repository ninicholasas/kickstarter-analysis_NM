I would like to share my analysis for Louise to start his crowd funding campaign.

First, as seen in the chart below about 65% of the crowd funding for theaters are successul.
![Parent Category Outcomes_US_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110373282/187087976-4d9ac450-93fa-4d86-a1be-bbd5df8b9f6e.png)
Also if you take a look at the next graph;
![US_Subcategory_plays](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110373282/187088177-2e3ea7ae-795d-4ac4-801b-797056c2f173.png)
above 60% of the crowd funding for the plays turn out to be a success in the US.
Now, if we take a look at the starting dates to start the funding;
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date_01](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110373282/187053375-9264a8db-f61a-4305-8d07-44bdbc84d998.png)
we can tell that May, June are the most successful months during the year.

Next, let's take a look at the Descriptive Statistics

As you can see from the chart the Mean of each Successful and Failed funding is about the same as the Upper Quartile.
But if we take a look at the Standard Deviation, the Successful funding is about 2 times the IQR, Failed fundings are almost 3 times.
Per this observation, we could say that Louis should lower his funding goal between $7,500 to $5,000.

To conclude my analysis, Louise should start the crowd funding for the play in the US either May or June with the goal amount in between $5,000 to $7,500.

*Per Louis's intersest in the Edinburgh's successes,

The campaign had an Average of;
* $2,100 Goal
* $40.00 average donation
* 62 backers

I hope this findings fulfils your request.
